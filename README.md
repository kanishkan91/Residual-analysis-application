# Multi dimensional residual analysis application in Python Dash.

Residuals are widely used as a part of statistical analysis. However, there are various dimensions that are available to analyze residuals such as the statistical relationships (relationships with different variables), temporal dimensions (the predicted vs actual value over time), cross-sectional dimensions (the value of individual observations) and metrics over time (summary stats over time). 

This python dashboard helps a user explore these dimensions for residuals (where Logged GDP is used as the IV) that are dynamically generated using a python function. Attached below is a screenshot showing the application-
